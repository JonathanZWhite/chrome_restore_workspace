### 👋

Hey Andrew,

So… You're probably wondering why I created a PR in your repo 😂 Some context 👇

**👻 Who?**
I'm Jonathan, co-founder of a stealth social commerce startup in SF 🌁 We're a technical team (ex-Airbnb and ex-Webflow) backed by investors like SignalFire, Fan Zhang (co-founder @ Sequoia Capital China), Lucy Guo (co-founder @ ScaleAI), and Jeff Morris Jr. (former CPO @ Tinder).

**🤫 What?**
We're redefining commerce through gamification making it interactive, social, and fun while creating economic value for everyday American. Single-player to multi-player 👯‍♀️

**🤔 Why?**
This is a ground floor opportunity to come in as our founding engineer and own the technical vision of our product. You'll be in the trenches with us, helping us go from 0 → 1. Whether this sounds scary, thrilling, or both, I would love to chat and hear your story.

Would you be open to a call sometime this week or next? 🔥 

Best,
Jonathan (jonathan@mrwhite.space)
